        <p>This year our Robotics group consists of about 120+ students in grades 9-12. The general cycle of activities the club concentrates on is determined by the schuedule of the FIRST Robotics Competition (FIRST RC) which is the governing body of the competition we compete in.</p>
        <p>During the months of October to December we are again gearing up for the next season - recruiting and training new student members of the club, helping in FLL leagues, and organizing our workshop. The club is organized into a set of sub-groups with students participating in one or more of the groups.</p>
        <p>The FIRST organization releases the details of the copetition in the month of January - this details the rules of the competition for all teams participating.  During the months of January and March, we are busy building our robot and getting ready for competition.</p>
        <p>Between April and September, we are giving back to our community by participating in Summer Parades, Scouting Merit Badge Workshops, Elementary School Science Fairs, Engineering Programs for students, and holding Food Donation Drives.</p>

        <h2>About FIRST</h2>
        <p>We are a team of proud students under the FIRST Organization. FIRST stands for “For Inspiration of Science and Technology.” Founded by Dean Kamen, the inventor of the Segway Scooter, this organization works together with students of all ages across the nation and around the world to bring a new spin to an old pursuit. Dean Kamen created FIRST “to transform our culture by creating a world where science and technology are celebrated and where young people dream of becoming science and technology heroes.” It is a worthy alternative to sporting events in its competitive, yet friendly methods of spreading knowledge about science, technology, and engineering. The core tenet and catchphrase of FIRST is “Gracious Professionalism,” an idea which encapsulates the camaraderie found at FIRST Events. As a phrase, it conjures images of kind and friendly interaction with other teams. As a lifestyle, it begs competition, but not in a vicious way. Rather, it brings teams together to achieve a common goal and together develop innovative ways to solve difficult problems.</p>

            <p>FIRST’s Mission Statement: “Our mission is to inspire young people to be science and technology leaders, by engaging them in exciting mentor-based programs that build science, engineering and technology skills, that inspire innovation, and that foster well-rounded life capabilities including self-confidence, communication and leadership.”</p>
